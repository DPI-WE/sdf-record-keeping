- English almanacs were bestsellers in the 17th century
    - (second to the Bible)
- An almanac is an annual publication that includes information such as:
   - weather forecasts
   - farmers' planting dates
   - tide tables
   - tabular information often arranged according to the calendar.

# <!--fit--> The killer application of writing, and printing, was *record keeping*

# <!--fit--> The killer application of computing is also *record keeping*

---

# <!--fit--> The heart of any application is the information it is keeping track of.

- Users, tweets, and who-follows-who in **Twitter**.
- Listings, bookings, and messages in **Airbnb**.
- Venues, reviews, and ratings in **Yelp**.

# Record Keeping

- We keep track of this information as records in plain old tables â€” just like they did in almanacs in the 17th century.
- One of the most important parts of application development is figuring out what information we need to keep track of, and a good set of tables to organize that information.


---
# Data Modeling

- This is part of the process known as **data modeling** (or "database design" or "database architecture").
- It's the most important and most challenging part of app development.
- It's an art, not a science. We'll spend time every week practicing. Let's dive in!

---
# Databases
- A *database* is the software we use to store information.
- It is just a set of tables
- It's like a spreadsheet where each table is one sheet.
- Try to think of them as just paper, like almanacs.

---

# Databases

- Whatever information we need to power our applications, we need to be able to figure out a way to store it in tables
- Whatever logic we need to solve our users' problems, we have to be able to describe how we'd do it as humans given paper tables.

---

# Databases
- Computers are just faster at doing this
- It will be the same operations:
    â€” looking up data that's relevant to a certian user
    - ordering things in certain way
    - filtering things by certain criteria
    - etc.

---
# One approach to database design
- We figure out the main things, "**nouns**", in our problem space and make a table for each.
- We add columns to each table for each attribute of the thing we need to keep track of.
- Our users create (or read, or update, or delete) rows.

---

# CRUD

- We say "create, read, update, or delete" so often â€” these are the fundamental 4 operations that all user actions map to â€” **CRUD**.
- 80%+ of the functionality of most SaaS applications is **CRUD**. This is what we will focus on learning how to build.

---


# Caveat #1
- Our users actions should not trigger creating tables or columns; only rows.
- We, the developers, will create all tables and columns up front, when we design and deploy the application.
- Users can **CRUD** a million rows per second if they want to.
- Users can't add tables or columns.

---

# Caveat #2

- **We will only store one value per cell.**
- A value can be a long blob of text, like a bio; but it can't be *multiple* bios for different people.

---

# Must See Movies

- Okay, this is all pretty abstract. Let's look at some examples.
- Lets examine an [application](https://msm.matchthetarget.com/) that we'll build in class. It's a very simplified version of the iMDB (the Internet Movie Database).
    - Click around it for a minute. Observe and identify:
    - How are the URLs named? What is indicated by each part of the URL?
    - What all information is being stored and displayed on each page?
    - If you had to design tables to store all of the information required to power that app, what would they be? What columns would they have? Think of questions.
- Let's experiment together.
